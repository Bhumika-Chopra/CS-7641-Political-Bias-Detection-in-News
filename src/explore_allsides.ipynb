         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-throws-immigration-system-uncertainty-parents-confront-potential/story?id=117965558",
         "As President Donald Trump starts to defend his executive order ending birthright citizenship in court, parents are beginning to grapple with the uncertainty stemming from his unprecedented executive order and the possibility that their future children could become \"stateless.\" Five pregnant undocumented women and two nonprofits on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in Maryland District Court challenging the order, which seeks to interpret the 14th Amendmentâ€™s guarantee of birthright citizenship as not applying to the children of undocumented parents. Joining the lawsuit under pseudonyms, the women argued that Trumpâ€™s order deprives their future children of their constitutional rights. \"The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens,\" the lawsuit said. The complaint makes a similar claim as the four other federal lawsuits signed on by a combined 22 states and two cities; however, this lawsuit differs by having multiple plaintiffs who would be directly impacted by the executive order. The 38-page filing provides personal details of how the lives of each woman and their future children would be changed under Trump's plan. Monica â€“ a medical doctor from Venezuela with temporary protected status who joined the lawsuit under the pseudonymâ€“ said she joined the lawsuit because she fears her future child will become stateless, as her home country facing an ongoing humanitarian, political and economic crisis. \"I'm 12 weeks pregnant. I should be worried about the health of my child. I should be thinking about that primarily and instead my husband and I are stressed, we're anxious and we're depressed about the reality that my child may not be able to become a US citizen,\" she said. Maribel â€“ who joined the lawsuit under a pseudonym along with four other women â€“ has lived in the United States for more than half her life after emigrating from El Salvador and Guatemala. She is due to have her third child in July but worries Trump's executive order will split her young family, the lawsuit said. \"She fears her unborn child will not have the same rights to citizenship as the future child's older sisters, and could even be subject to deportation, separating the family,\" the lawsuit read. \"Every day, babies are being born in the United States whose constitutionally guaranteed citizenship will be called into doubt under the Executive Order,\" the lawsuit argued. Liza and her husband Igor fled Russia to the United States for asylum, and they are expecting a child in May. They can't imagine being forced to bring their newborn back to a country that will likely prosecute them, the lawsuit said. \"Neither Liza nor Igor feel they can return to Russia without being persecuted, and they therefore do not feel they can apply for Russian citizenship for their child. Because of that, Liza and Igor are worried their child will be stateless,\" the lawsuit said. Juana â€“ who is two months pregnant â€“ fears what the future might hold for her and her future child if they are sent back to Colombia if her asylum claim falls through, according to the lawsuit. \"She wants her unborn child to be able to grow up without fear and with a sense of belonging in the United States. The thought that her unborn child could be denied U.S. citizenship and deported to Colombia without her is terrifying,\" the lawsuit said. Trinidad is a Venezuelan immigrant who is due in August, but she fears that her child will be stateless under Trump's executive order, caught between Venezuela's democratic crisis and the legal tumult of the United States immigration system, the lawsuit said. Monica and her partner both have Temporary Protected Status after seeking asylum from Venezuela in the United States, but they are worried their child may be ineligible for both the United States and Venezuelan citizenship. Monica said she came to the United States in 2019 with her husband and thought they were doing \"everything the right way\" by paying taxes, working and buying their own home, she said. \"We had reached a point of stability in this country and wanted to have a child,\" Monica said. A happy change in their lives quickly devolved into fear, she said, when they saw Trump act on his promise to end the United States' promise of birthright citizenship with the swipe of a sharpie. \"This is a really difficult situation where I truly do not see a way out for my child, a way forward for my child to be able to get through this,\" she said. Because Venezuela no longer offers consular services in the United States, Monica said she is unable to explore the possibility of getting her child citizenship there. Her lawyers do not know if Trump's executive order would apply to people with temporary protected status, so determining if her child will be an American citizen meant filing a lawsuit against the president, she said. \"This executive order has just left us with more uncertainty than even before. Will my child be a US citizen? Will he be nothing? We just do not know what to do,\" she said.",

         "From a multimillion-dollar law firm payout to six-figure endorsements and book deals, President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raked in at least $12 million in total income in the past two years, new personal financial disclosure forms show. Kennedy boasted a vast amount of wealth across various investment funds, bank accounts and real estate properties totaling between $8.6 million to $33.4 million. However, he also reported a staggering amount of liabilities -- between $3.4 million and $12.7 million -- which could put him in the red on paper. Kennedy's liabilities include up to $1.2 million in credit card debt to American Express at a 23% revolving interest rate and three 30-year mortgages worth up to $10.5 million, according to the filing. The exact values of his total assets and liabilities are unclear because federal financial disclosures are reported in ranges. A major chunk of Kennedy's income since 2023 was his nearly $9 million payout from his law firm Kennedy & Madonna LLP, which is now called Madonna & Madonna LLP after Kennedy resigned last week. His main source of income from the past year stemmed from hefty referral fees from multiple law firms, arrangements which Kennedy noted in his ethics agreement that he will terminate upon his confirmation. However, he stated he plans to retain a contingency fee interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. government. In his ethics agreement, Kennedy disclosed that among the cases he has referred to the Wisner Baum law firm are claims filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), from which he said he will divest his interest. Kennedy, who has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency and has spoken at multiple Bitcoin conventions, also reported owning between $1 million to $5 million in Fidelityâ€™s Bitcoin fund, the filing shows. Kennedy also disclosed smaller holdings in biotech companies Dragonfly Therapeutics and CRISPR Therapeutics AG, as well as in other companies like Progressive Corp, Amazon and Apple, from which he said he plans to divest after his confirmation. Kennedy's credit card debt potentially doubled in just six months, a comparison of his liabilities in his new disclosure filing and his disclosure from last year suggest. In July 2024, Kennedy, as a presidential candidate, disclosed having credit card debts to American Express worth $360,004 to $715,000, at roughly 23% revolving interest rate. In his latest disclosure submitted in late December 2024 and publicly released today, Kennedy's American Express debts snowballed into between $610,000 and $1.2 million. It's unclear how much, exactly, his credit card debt increased in the past few months because liabilities are reported in ranges, but the latest disclosure shows his debts have potentially grown exponentially. Kennedy is set to earn millions from multiple book deals, including up to $4 million in advances for books titled â€œUnsettled Scienceâ€ and â€œA Defense for Israel.â€ Kennedy also earned $1,000 for an advance for a book titled â€œVax-UnVax: Let the Science Speak.â€ According to his disclosure, two of the three books have already been written prior to his nomination, and he does not plan to engage in â€œwriting, editing, marketing, or promotional servicesâ€ while serving as HHS Secretary. Kennedy earned little income from the fourteen books he has already published â€“ such as \"American Values: Lessons I Learned from my Family\" and \"Vaccine Villains: What the American Public Should Know about the Industry\" â€” making less than $200 from each title, according to the disclosure form. Kennedy earned $100,000 from his endorsement of a boxing ball game called Boxbollen in a video he posted on his social media accounts last month, though he returned $50,000 after cancelling the contract following his nomination as health and human services secretary. \"Mr. Kennedy had a pre-existing contract prior to his nomination, after posting the video - he realized it was best to delete it and cancel the contract,â€ a source close to Kennedy told ABC News in November. Kennedy also earned $200,000 in speaking fees during three days in November, speaking at the Rockbridge Fall Summit in Las Vegas -- organized by a conservative donor network co-founded by Vice President JD Vance â€“ and Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona. Kennedy also disclosed dozens of sources of compensation from his wife Cheryl Hines, an actress best known for her role on HBOâ€™s \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" In addition to that show, Hines earns residual payments from multiple films and television shows including \"Friends,\" \"Herbie,\" \"Waitress,\" \"The Conners,\" \"The Flight Attendant\" and \"A Bad Moms Christmas.\" Hines also received a $600,000 advance payment for her memoir \"My Shade of Crazy.\" As was disclosed in his previous financial disclosure from his 2024 presidential bid, Kennedy had previously owned oil and gas rights in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida but sold them in the past year, netting roughly $55,000 from the sales, according to the filing. He also reported owning commercial properties in Chicago worth between $700,000 and $1.5 million.",

         "Trump moves to brand Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization again",
         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-moves-brand-houthis-foreign-terrorist-organization/story?id=117993342",
         "President Donald Trump issued an executive order initiating a process to redesignate the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization on Wednesday, returning the group to the same status it held at the end of his first administration. \"This order sets in motion a process by which Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, shall be considered for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization,\" the executive order said, noting that the group has \"fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times since 2023, endangering American men and women in uniform,\" and attacked more than 100 commercial ships, killing four civilian sailors. The order goes on to direct Secretary of State Marco Rubio to submit a report to the president on designating the Houthis as a FTO within 30 days and then \"take all appropriate action\" with regard to the designation within 15 days after that. If the Houthis are designated as an FTO at that point, the order instructs the U.S. Agency for International Development to work with the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations and contractors to identify partners in Yemen who have made payments to Houthi rebels or entities they control, criticized efforts to counter the Houthis or failed to document abuses committed by the group. \"The Administrator of USAID shall take all appropriate action to terminate the projects, grants, or contracts identified,\" the order said. Rubio has previously voiced support for labeling the Houthis as a FTO and is expected to move forward with the designation. During the waning weeks of his first term, Trump's State Department designated the Houthis, who control large swaths of Yemen, as a FTO and a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\" group. The Biden administration quickly undid both measures out of concern that the penalties they carry would limit the ability to supply Yemeni civilians with aid amid the country's grueling civil war. However, after the Houthis began launching attacks on vessels transiting vital Middle Eastern shipping lanes following the onset of the Israeli-Hamas war, Biden officials moved to reimpose the Specially Designated Global Terrorist label in January 2024. They opted against reinstating the more severe FTO designation out of concern it would adversely affect humanitarian support. \"A foreign terrorist organization designation ran the risk of having a deterrent effect on some of those aid groups continuing to provide aid -- worrying that they might be charged as providing material support to a terrorist organization,\" then-State Department spokesman Matthew Miller explained at the time. Although FTO and SDGT designations are often used by the U.S. government in tandem, the FTO designation is considered to be a harsher punishment because it criminalizes providing any material support to the organization, automatically bars members of the group who are not American citizens from entering the United States and allows victims of the group's attacks and their survivors to sue for compensation. In recent days, Houthi leaders have signaled that the group intends to scale down attacks on maritime traffic in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, indicating militants will only target Israeli vessels. On Wednesday, the Houthis also released the crew of a seized cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader, which it seized in November 2023. The vice president of the government of Yemen has credited Trump's return to the White House for motivating the Houthis to stand down, citing the president's leadership and willingness to employ the strength of the U.S. military. The Houthis have said the change in posture is a response to a fragile ceasefire agreement taking hold in Gaza. But the group's promises to limit attacks have done little to quell the concerns of global shipping companies, as the Houthis have often targeted ships with no connection to the conflict during its 15-month campaign -- even striking vessels destined for Iran, its chief financial and military backer. While humanitarian groups remain concerned that Trump's renewed FTO designation could disrupt the flow of food, medicine and other key aid that two-thirds of Yemen's population relies on, Yemeni officials, Republican lawmakers and even some Democrats have argued in favor of reimposing the designation against the Houthis. Moammar al Eryani, Yemen's minister of information and culture, decried the Biden administration's decision to stop at the SDGT designation, arguing it \"gave Houthis more space to receive Iranian support and continue its destructive scheme and reinforced its sense that crimes against humanity could be overlooked under political pretexts.\" By contrast, Eryani argued that the FTO label would \"enable the international community to take decisive measures to deter them, dry up their sources of funding, and force them to surrender their weapons.\" Ahead of Trump's executive order, a group of 15 Republican senators proposed legislation that would redesignate the Houthis as an FTO, and in November 2024, a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote a letter to then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to reapply the label.",

houthis who control large swaths of yemen as a fto and a specially designated global terrorist group the biden administration quickly undid both measures out of concern that the penalties they carry would limit the ability to supply yemeni civilians with aid amid the country grueling civil war however after the houthis began launching attacks on vessels transiting vital middle eastern shipping lanes following the onset of the israeli hamas war biden officials moved to reimpose the specially designated global terrorist label in january they opted against reinstating the more severe fto designation out of concern it would adversely affect humanitarian support a foreign terrorist organization designation ran the risk of having a deterrent effect on some of those aid groups continuing to provide aid worrying that they might be charged as providing material support to a terrorist organization then state department spokesman matthew miller explained at the time although fto and sdgt designations are often used by the government in tandem the fto designation is considered to be a harsher punishment because it criminalizes providing any material support to the organization automatically bars members of the group who are not american citizens from entering the united states and allows victims of the group attacks and their survivors to sue for compensation in recent days houthi leaders have signaled that the group intends to scale down attacks on maritime traffic in the red sea and the gulf of aden indicating militants will only target israeli vessels on wednesday the houthis also released the crew of a seized cargo ship the galaxy leader which it seized in november the vice president of the government of yemen has credited trump return to the white house for motivating the houthis to stand down citing the president leadership and willingness to employ the strength of the military the houthis have said the change in posture is a response to a fragile ceasefire agreement taking hold in gaza but the group promises to limit attacks have done little to quell the concerns of global shipping companies as the houthis have often targeted ships with no connection to the conflict during its month campaign even striking vessels destined for iran its chief financial and military backer while humanitarian groups remain concerned that trump renewed fto designation could disrupt the flow of food medicine and other key aid that two thirds of yemen population relies on yemeni officials republican lawmakers and even some democrats have argued in favor of reimposing the designation against the houthis moammar al eryani yemen minister of information and culture decried the biden administration decision to stop at the sdgt designation arguing it gave houthis more space to receive iranian support and continue its destructive scheme and reinforced its sense that crimes against humanity could be overlooked under political pretexts by contrast eryani argued that the fto label would enable the international community to take decisive measures to deter them dry up their sources of funding and force them to surrender their weapons ahead of trump executive order a group of republican senators proposed legislation that would redesignate the houthis as an fto and in november a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote a letter to then secretary of state antony blinken asking him to reapply the label",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-john-fetterman-trumps-executive-actions-visiting-mar/story?id=117934834",
         "President Donald Trump launched his plan to reshape America on Monday by signing executive actions to reverse Joe Biden-era policies and deliver on key campaign promises. He signed the first batch in front of a large crowd at Capital One Arena before going to the Oval Office to sign more. On his first full day in office, Trump ordered the closure of all executive branch diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and placed their employees on leave. ABC News spoke with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, on Tuesday to discuss Jan. 6 pardons, the Laken Riley Act, and his meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [The senator, to better hear the conversation, used his phone to caption the questions he was asked.] ABC NEWS: In these divided times in Washington, we wanted to hear from a senator who has pledged to work across the aisle. Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the first sitting Democrat to head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump. What was that meeting like? And what are his thoughts on the flurry of early actions? Busy day, first day for President Trump. Iâ€™d like to start with the pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters. Of course, he's had sweeping pardons for roughly 1,500 of them, including some who committed violent acts against police officers. Your reaction to those pardons as far as the message that it might send? SEN. FETTERMAN: Yeah, there were a lot of those pardons that day that I don't agree with any more than some of the pardons that President Biden dropped that I didn't agree with those as well, too. I actually agreed on a lot of the pardons that I've signed on as lieutenant governor. I believe in second chances. Some people are very deserving of a second chance and get a pardon. And there's some that I don't agree that do that. So I don't agree with, I don't agree with them. Many of those that I didn't agree with the president as well, too. ABC NEWS: Yeah. What is your response? Because I know at one point you had suggested that you thought that it would be a good idea for President Biden to pardon President-elect Trump with regard to the hush money case. Now, we knowâ€¦ FETTERMAN: What, what I'm saying, though, that, that, pardons I can agree with, some that I don't. And I think that's really what it comes down to. ABC NEWS: You obviously co-sponsored the Laken Riley Act, which was passed late yesterday. Some Democrats have said that they're unhappy with it, including Senator Kaine who said that it's bad policy. What's your reaction to that? FETTERMAN: I mean, they're entitled to their opinions and their views. And I believe as someone that's very, very pro-immigration, as I have been consistently, that we can be very pro-immigration and we should need a secure border. And if those people that have a criminal record or people that are actively engaging in criminal behavior, I don't know why it's controversial that those people should, should, they need to go. ABC NEWS: As you know, President Trump declared an emergency at the southern border. Your thoughts on that? Good idea? Bad idea? FETTERMAN: Well, I think if 300,000 people were showing up on the border, as they were during a month, not that long ago, I think it's important that we create a secure border. And that's really pretty much where we are. ABC NEWS: As you know, initially President Trump at one point had called you a raging lunatic, but then you went down. You're only the first sitting Democratic senator to actually go down to Mar-a-Lago. Days later, he said he thought that you were impressive. Can you take us to that moment and give us a sense of how that meeting went with you and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago? FETTERMAN: I just, I was invited to have a conversation with the president and that I did. And that's what happened. ABC NEWS: Do you share a lot of his ideals? FETTERMAN: Do I, a lot of his ideals? ABC NEWS: Yes. FETTERMAN: I'm a Democrat. It's a strange question. ABC NEWS: Well, I guess I'm wondering what made him goâ€¦ FETTERMAN: I mean, there's many things that I won't agree with and there might be some that I do agree on that. But I am a Democrat and I'm going to remain a Democrat. So there's many of his ideals that I don't agree with. But that's pretty much how it works here. Some Democrats aren't going to agree with a lot of the things. ABC NEWS: Right. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, at one point, he's saying you're a raging lunatic. And then he describes you as impressive. Was there any kind of extension of an olive branch, a meeting of the minds at Mar-a-Lago that caused him to have at least such a shift? FETTERMAN: You know, I think if we all refuse to engage and talk to people that may have said things in the past that you might not appreciate, then we wouldn't be having conversations with a lot of people amongst ourselves. ABC NEWS: I know that you've denied rumors that you would switch parties. Would you ever consider becoming an Independent? FETTERMAN: No, that was never, that was never part of any conversation. And if you want to choose to respond to some weird things that you might read online, that's your, that's up to you. But that's not any part of any conversation I've ever considered. ABC NEWS: The advice that you've given to some of your Democratic colleagues who are concerned about a second term with Trump is you've got to chill out. And I'm wondering if there was any action or any words that he said on his first day that gave you pause? FETTERMAN: Well, a lot of things. A lot of things. But he claimed that that's what's coming and that's where we are on that. And we all have a choice to respond to every last thing or whatever. But I'm going to kind of continue to find a lot of consistent wins for Pennsylvania. ABC NEWS: Obviously, as we mentioned before, you were able to have the, the bipartisan bill with Laken Riley. Any other primary goals that you feel like you'd like to work, reach across the aisle with Republicans on, on upcoming legislation? FETTERMAN: You know, as they emerge and continue to find and have those ongoing conversations with members of my colleagues here in the Senate. And remember, the Republicans are going to drive the agenda and I'm going to find a way to work together along on all of those kinds of priorities. ABC NEWS: All right, Sen. Fetterman, thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/oath-keepers-proud-boys-leaders-prison-after-trump/story?id=117940370",
         "Enrique Tarrio, the former head of the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, the head of the Oath Keepers, were released Tuesday from prison following President Donald Trump's sweeping pardon of those convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. They were serving 22- and 18-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the riot. A federal judge sentenced Rhodes in May 2023 after he was convicted of seditious conspiracy the year prior for his and his group's role in the riot. The Oath Keepers had stockpiled weapons at a D.C. hotel and organized the attack, according to prosecutors. Rhodes himself did not enter the Capitol on Jan. 6 and maintained that his group only intended to provide security and medical aid to those attending multiple pro-Trump demonstrations in the area, prosecutors said. Rhodes was convicted of leading members of the Oath Keepers in an attempt to use the violent Capitol attack to stop the peaceful transfer of power. \"That was a bunch of nonsense,\" Rhodes told ABC News while standing at a protest outside the DC Central Detention Facility after being released on Tuesday. \"I believe the 2020 election was unconstitutional. It violated state election laws,\" Rhodes said. Tarrio was sentenced in September 2023 for his conviction on seditious conspiracy and given the longest sentence of all of the convicted Jan. 6 rioters, though he was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6. During his sentencing, prosecutors pointed to a nine-page strategic plan to \"storm\" government buildings in Washington on Jan. 6 that was found in Tarrio's possession after the riot, as well as violent rhetoric they say he routinely used in messages with other members of the group about what they would do if Congress moved forward in certifying President Joe Biden's election win. Former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who stepped down ahead of Trump taking office, described both the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers as domestic extremist groups. \"Certainly the Capitol attack involved violent extremists,\" Wray said during testimony in March 2021 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"As I said, we the FBI consider this a form of domestic terrorism. It included a variety of backgrounds, certainly there were quite a number -- we are seeing quite a number as we are building out the cases on the individuals we have arrested for the violence quite a number who what we would call sort of militia violent extremists so we've got a number who self-identify with the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers, things like that.\" Four years after they raided the Capitol, threatened Congress members and assaulted police officers, a group of some of the Jan. 6 rioters convicted of the most violent incidents that day are now free men thanks to Trump. Other convicted members were scheduled to be released throughout the day from Washington, D.C. area, jails and prisons. Of the nearly 1,600 individuals who have faced charges associated with the Capitol attack, according to figures released by the U.S. Attorney's Office, 608 individuals faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement trying to protect the complex that day, the office said. Approximately 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot, the Department of Justice has said. As more of the rioters were released from jails and prisons, a group of Trump supporters, Proud Boys members and others gathered and cheered them on. The group carried large flagpoles with Trump and American flags attached and signage that read, \"no man left behind\" and \"pardon all j6 hostages day one.\" Current and former DOJ officials have expressed alarm over the potential that Trump would hand down pardons -- or otherwise free -- violent offenders, citing the potential risk they could seek to target the prosecutors who oversaw their cases, the judges who sentenced them to periods of incarceration, or witnesses who may have testified against them.",

         "Lightning-rod immigration bill set to go to Trump's desk after House passage",
         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-vote-laken-riley-act-teeing-immigration-crackdown/story?id=117984047",
         "The House passed an amended version of the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday on a vote of 263-156, teeing up major immigration reform at the start of President Donald Trump's second administration. Forty-six Democrats joined Republicans in voting in favor of the bill, breaking with Democratic leadership. The bill, which was expected to pass two weeks after it initially passed the bill, will now go to Trump's desk and symbolically will become the first measure he signs into law of his second administration. The updated measure, which cleared the Senate with some Democratic support on Tuesday, requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants for theft-related crimes and includes amendments from Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst that expanded the scope of offenses that trigger detention. The death of Riley, a 22-year-old woman who was murdered by Jose Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant, on Feb. 22, 2024, fueled the immigration debate in the United States and became a lightning rod issue for Trump on the campaign trail. Ibarra had illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 but was allowed to stay in the U.S. while his case was ongoing, and he had been charged with misdemeanor shoplifting while living in Georgia. The legislation will require immigration officers to detain undocumented immigrants who are suspected of minor criminal offenses, including shoplifting. It also grants power to attorneys general to sue the federal government if they can show their states are being harmed over failure to implement national immigration policies, as well as allows states to sue the Department of Homeland Security for harm caused to citizens allegedly due to illegal immigration. \"We're putting the safety and security of Americans first with this commonsense piece of legislation, so it's a big deal,\" Alabama Sen. Katie Britt said Wednesday. \"Whether it's from fentanyl overdoses or whether it is the tragedy that occurred to Laken Riley or Rachel Morin or Jocelyn Nungaray or its countless number of people -- today, we said we hear you to the American people.\" The bill, a major Republican-driven initiative, originally cleared the House on a vote of 264-159 on Jan. 7, with 48 Democrats joined Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. The amended version then passed the Senate, the first bill to pass in the chamber this session, on Tuesday on a vote of 64-35, with support from 12 Democrats, which resulted in the new bill going back to the House for final approval. \"Illegal migrants shouldn't be here in the first place,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on the Senate floor leading up to a vote on the bill. \"Everybody knows that it is against the law to enter the United States without our permission. Even so, if they come here violating our law, they hurt and kill an American, the federal government must prioritize their detention and deportation.\" Cornyn's amendment, which adds assault of a law enforcement officer to the list of crimes that would mandate detention of an undocumented migrant, passed with substantial Democratic support, 70-25. The bill previously passed the House in the last Congress but was not taken up in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \"Chuck Schumer made it clear that in a Democrat Senate, they had no desire to stand up for women who were assaulted by people here illegally,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said ahead of the vote Wednesday. \"Joe Biden would not have signed that bill, but now with John Thune, you have the same House majority, but you now have a willing partner in the Senate that actually wants to confront real problems facing families so that you don't have more Laken Riley, you don't have more murders of innocent people because of an open border.\" ICE estimated enforcement of the bill will cost close to $27 billion in its first year, according to a document obtained by ABC News, up from a previous estimate of $3.2 billion. ICE has said a lack of cooperation from local and state law enforcement officials may make their jobs more difficult and that going after people for property crimes might prevent them from targeting \"more egregious offenders.\" After a recent review of immigrants in their nondetained docket, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations found about 110,000 people with offenses referenced in the act, the document said. That's up from its original count of over 60,000. To enforce the law, ICE would need to expand detention capacity to 151,500 beds. It is currently only funded to have 41,500 beds. \"Full implementation would be impossible for ICE to execute within existing resources,\" the document noted. \"This bill comes with an astronomical price tag and will create more problems than it solves,\" said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat. \"It will make our immigration system more chaotic and our country less safe. Under this bill, people charged with serious crimes will be released because detention centers will be forced to detain a child who stole a pack of gum from a gas station instead.\" On Tuesday, 13 Senate Democrats sent a letter to Thune committing to working with Republicans in \"good faith\" toward providing the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to pass certain immigration and border security measures. \"We can solve big challenges when we work together, and there is much work to do to improve border security, protect Dreamers and farmworkers, and fix our immigration system to better reflect the needs of our country and our modern economy,\" the Democrats wrote. \"These issues require bipartisan cooperation and we stand ready to work with you to develop meaningful and long-lasting solutions to these important issues that have gone unaddressed for far too long under both Democratic and Republican-controlled government.\" Of the 13 who signed the letter, 10 voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act. Those votes were necessary in helping that bill hit the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. ABC News' Arthur Jones II contributed to this report.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dc-judges-slam-trump-pardons-revisionist-myth-change/story?id=117986482",
         "In the days since President Donald Trump handed down pardons and commutations for the more than 1,500 of his supporters who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, federal judges in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia have remained essentially silent while signing off on the hundreds of now-dismissed cases that for years crowded their court dockets. On Wednesday, three judges with the D.C. District Court broke that silence on Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters, with one eviscerating Trump's proclamation that stated he was righting a \"national injustice\" that occurred through the prosecution of the pro-Trump mob. \"No 'national injustice' occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,\" Judge Beryl Howell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said in an order Wednesday. \"No 'process of national reconciliation' can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity.\" She added, \"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law. Yet, this presidential pronouncement of a 'national injustice' is the sole justification provided in the government's motion to dismiss the pending indictment.\" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, also made clear in a dismissal order for one Capitol defendant that Trump's sweeping pardons \"will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\" \"What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions analyzing and recounting the evidence through a neutral lens,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote. \"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.\" Kollar-Kotelly further used her order to honor the law enforcement officers who responded to the Capitol that day, which she said \"cannot be altered or ignored.\" \"What role law enforcement played that day and the heroism of each officer who responded also cannot be altered or ignored,\" she said. \"Grossly outnumbered, those law enforcement officers acted valiantly to protect the Members of Congress, their staff, the Vice President and his family, the integrity of the Capitol grounds, and the Capitol Building-our symbol of liberty and a symbol of democratic rule around the world,\" she added. \"For hours, those officers were aggressively confronted and violently assaulted. More than 140 officers were injured. Others tragically passed away as a result of the events of that day. But law enforcement did not falter. Standing with bear spray streaming down their faces, those officers carried out their duty to protect.\" She closed her order, stating bluntly, \"All of what I have described has been recorded for posterity, ensuring that what transpired on January 6, 2021 can be judged accurately in the future.\" Trump's Monday order commuted the sentences of 14 people and offered \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.\" The order fulfilled a campaign promise the president repeatedly made on the campaign trail. Howell's statement came through her dismissal of a case against two violent Jan. 6 rioters, Nicholas DeCarlo and Nicholas Ochs, who admitted to throwing smoke bombs at officers trying to protect the Capitol building. Howell refused to dismiss the case \"with prejudice,\" as requested by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which would leave open the possibility the prosecution could one day be resumed, though their statutes of limitations will run out by the end of this administration. \"This Court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,\" Howell said. \"Bluntly put, the assertion offered in the presidential pronouncement for the pending motion to dismiss is flatly wrong.\" Later Wednesday, the federal judge who oversaw Trump's criminal case related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election joined the growing chorus of judges breaking their silence. \"No pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021,\" said Judge Tanya Chutkan, another Obama appointee, in a brief order granting the dismissal of one rioter's criminal case. \"The dismissal of this case cannot undo the 'rampage [that] left multiple people dead, injured more than 140 people, and inflicted millions of dollars in damage.' ... And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power. \"In hundreds of cases like this one over the past four years, judges in this district have administered justice without fear or favor,\" she added. \"The historical record established by those proceedings must stand, unmoved by political winds, as a testament and as a warning.\"",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-wield-americas-power-world/story?id=117886041",
         "Donald Trump returned to office as president on Monday, reassuming his duties as commander in chief. His position once again puts him in charge of the worldâ€™s most powerful military, which -- often at his discretion -- can either engage in lethal warfare or act as a deterrent and a force for peace. How Trump behaved as commander in chief during his first administration may offer a guide for the next four years. In Monday's inauguration speech, Trump set the tone for a significant change in U.S. foreign policy that could have seismic implications for America's friends and foes. \"Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission -- defeating America's enemies,\" he said. His recent comments about taking over the Panama Canal and Greenland -- refusing to rule out the use of military force to do so -- raised eyebrows, along with referring to neighboring Canada as \"the 51st state.\" He also signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as \"Gulf of America\" on Monday. \"It was an intent to grab that media attention and put himself at the center of the news cycle,\" retired Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told ABC News. \"This unpredictability means that all paths lead back to the Oval Office and his next statement.\" However, Trump's slogans about making America great and putting America first may soon bump up against his need for the world to see him as a dealmaker. The war in Ukraine has been raging since 2022, but he's promised to bring it to an end. \"Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" he said last August. \"Iâ€™ll get it settled very fast.\" Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that if the war doesnâ€™t end soon, Ukraine could get substantially more aid. At the same time, he has told Ukraine it wonâ€™t receive more U.S. support unless it enters into peace talks. Last week, White House budget director nominee Russell Vought declined during his Senate confirmation hearing to fully commit to doling out $3.8 billion in aid that Congress has already approved. China's threats against Taiwan and international shipping may also embolden Trump to show Chinese President Xi Jinping that America believes it has the upper hand militarily. \"He will always defer to a solution that makes him appear strong and in charge,\" Lute told ABC News. \"So I don't think that there's an easy way to simply walk away from a big competition with China.\" The situation at the border between the U.S. and Mexico is also top of mind, with Trump declaring a national emergency in his inaugural address. \"I will end the practice of catch and release and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\" he said. The biggest difference in American foreign policy may be seen in the Middle East, and the war between Israel and Hamas. On Jan. 7, he created a deadline for a Gaza ceasefire deal in exchange for Hamas releasing hostages they took in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. \"If the deal isnâ€™t done before I take office, which is now going to be in two weeks â€¦ all hell will break out,\" he said during a news conference. Then, last week, the outgoing Biden administration -- along with incoming Trump envoys -- helped broker a ceasefire and hostage exchange that went into effect on Sunday. However, the agreement is fragile and fraught with pitfalls. In particular, it remains unclear who will govern Gaza if the peace lasts. The images on the streets betray an uncomfortable reality. Itâ€™s still the gunmen of Hamas in charge -- a situation unacceptable to the Israeli government. The Trump administration is also unlikely to accept Hamas being in control. Beyond Gaza, the situation in the Middle East has gone through considerable changes since Trump was last president. Iran, a major power in the region, has seen many of its allies weakened by various conflicts. Hamas has been left devastated and weakened by months of conflict with Israel. Lebanese political party and armed group Hezbollah -- designated as a terror group by the U.S. -- is a shadow of its former strength, with its leader Hassan Nasrallah killed in an Israeli strike in September. Former Syrian President Bashar Assad also fled from his country, his family held power for more than 50 years, after his regime was toppled by a rebel offensive in December. Amid this new balance of power, Trump wants to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a pact could bring peace and stability in the region -- the Biden administration was working to broker this agreement prior to Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel. The Trump administration faces immense international challenges -- and America going it alone may not be a viable option.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-pardons-rioters-disturbing-former-top-jan-6/story?id=117975874",
         "President Donald Trump's sweeping pardons and commutations for nearly all of the rioters charged with joining the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol was \"disturbing\" and an affront to the law enforcement officers who were assaulted at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, a former top prosecutor from the D.C. U.S. attorney's office told ABC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday. \"It's disturbing because what it says to the victims, to the officers who put their lives on the line that day to defend the country, and also to the officers who then went and told their stories and testified in court â€” reliving the trauma of that day over and over and subjected themselves to cross-examination,\" Alexis Loeb, who oversaw multiple high profile Jan. 6 cases during her time as deputy chief of the office's Capitol Breach section, told ABC news. \"It's disturbing because of what it says about the rule of law and the message it sends about political violence being acceptable and attacks on the peaceful transfer of power, something that has distinguished our nation, being acceptable,\" Loeb said. Trump has defended his decision to hand down pardons and halt the ongoing prosecutions for nearly all of the more than 1,500 people charged in the four years since the attack on the Capitol, even in the face of criticism from some Republican Senators. Many of those pardoned were convicted in engaging in brutal attacks against the roughly 140 law enforcement officers injured in the attack â€” documented through thousands of hours of videos and police body camera footage â€” using weapons from bats, hockey sticks, bear spray and stun guns. \"I'm the friend of â€” I am the friend of police, more than any president that's ever been in this office,\" Trump said. Sixteen other Jan. 6 rioters had their sentences commuted. â€œAs you know, we commuted about 16 of them because it looks like they could have done things that were not acceptable for a full pardon, but these people have served years of jail. Their lives have been ruined ..., \" Trump said at an event Tuesday night. \"They served years in jail. And if you look at the American public, the American public is tired of it. Take a look at the election. Just look at the numbers on the election.â€ Loeb told ABC News Trump's pardons may have wiped away the cases and guilty verdicts against the rioters, but they could not erase the historical record of their many crimes. \"These were prosecutions staffed by career prosecutors and FBI agents of all sorts of political persuasions who came together and prosecuted these cases because they all recognized that attacking police officers was wrong, breaking into the Capitol was wrong,\" Loeb said. \"And what the pardons did do, was that they wiped away the verdicts and the sentences, not the historical record of what happened, but the verdicts and the sentences and the verdicts and the sentences were handed down by juries made up of ordinary citizens and judges appointed by both political parties, including several judges who were appointed by President Trump.\" After the attack on the U.S. Capitol by rioters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, more than 1,580 people were charged criminally in federal court, according to the Department of Justice. More than 1,000 have pleaded guilty. That figure includes 608 individuals who have faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement trying to protect the complex that day, the office said. Approximately 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot, the DOJ has said. The U.S. Attorney's Office previously said it is evaluating whether to bring charges in roughly 200 cases that have been referred to them by the FBI, about 60 of which involve potential felony charges involving allegations of assault or impeding law enforcement. Trump's executive order, however, appears to have completely shuttered the probe and the FBI removed from its website previous 'wanted' posters it had for violent rioters who had yet to be identified. At least 221 individuals have been found guilty at contested trials in U.S. District Court, the DOJ said. Another 40 individuals have been convicted following an agreed-upon set of facts presented to and accepted by the court. Some current and former DOJ officials have expressed alarm at the potential that the pardons could lead some now-freed defendants to target some of the former prosecutors who oversaw their cases, the judges who sentenced them, or witnesses who may have testified against them at trial. Loeb declined to say whether she was personally concerned about the threat of retribution from those she prosecuted, and instead expressed confidence in the integrity of the legal system that resulted in the rioters' convictions. \"The juries overwhelmingly found that the government had proved its case by a beyond a reasonable doubt, and the juries paid close attention throughout the trial and were just riveted by the video that came from all angles,\" Loeb said. \"These were some of the most documented crimes, I think, that we've ever seen.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday he supports â€œredemptionâ€ and â€œsecond chancesâ€ for Jan. 6 Capitol rioters after Trumpâ€™s sweeping pardons. At his weekly press conference, Johnson was asked how Republicans can tout â€œbacking the blueâ€ if they support pardons for those convicted of assaulting police officers during the attack. â€œThe president has the pardon and commutation authority. It's his decision,â€ Johnson said. â€œAnd I think what was made clear all along is that peaceful protests and people who engage in that should never be punished. There was a weaponization of the Justice Department.\" Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters received condemnation from some unions that represent law enforcement. \"The vast majority of Americans do not support letting those who assault or attack law enforcement off the hook 'scot-free,'\" the Capitol Police Officersâ€™ Union said in a statement. \"This use of presidential power is not what Americans want to see and itâ€™s not what law enforcement officers deserve.\" â€œThe FBI Agents Association (FBIAA) strongly condemns acts of violence targeting law enforcement officers who serve and protect our communities. Accordingly, the FBIAA does not believe granting pardons or clemency for individuals convicted of such acts is appropriate,\" a statement from the union said Wednesday. The Fraternal Order of Police, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, and The International Association of Chiefs of Police also criticized the pardons. \"Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety â€” they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law,\" the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police said in a joint statement Tuesday. \"Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families. When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence.\"",

         "Former President Joe Biden wished President Donald Trump \"all the best for the next four years\" in the letter he left in the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, Fox News reported Wednesday. Trump said Tuesday night that he opened the letter and called it \"very nice.\" \"Just basically, it was a little bit of an inspirational type of letter, you know? 'Joy, do a good job. Important, very important, how important the job is.' But I may, I think it was a nice letter. I think I should let people see it, because it was a positive for him, in writing it, I appreciated the letter,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday evening. Read aloud on Fox News Wednesday morning, the letter was addressed â€œDear President Trumpâ€ and was two paragraphs long. â€œAs I take leave of this sacred office I wish you and your family all the best in the next four years. The American people â€“ and people around the world â€“ look to this house for steadiness in the inevitable storms of history, and my prayer is that in the coming years will be a time of prosperity, peace, and grace for our nation,â€ Biden wrote Trump. He closed with a prayer, â€œMay God bless you and guide you as He has blessed and guided our beloved country since our founding.\" Trump appeared to discover the letter Biden left for him on Monday evening in the Oval Office when speaking with reporters. When one asked whether he'd found the letter, Trump opened the drawer of the desk and found it, apparently for the first time. It was in a small white envelope with \"47\" written on the front and underlined. â€œIt could have been years before we found this thing. Wow, thank you,â€ Trump said. Biden continued the tradition of leaving a letter for his successor -- one Trump continued in 2020 when he left after his first term, turning over the office to Biden. Trump also reflected on his return to the Oval Office, when asked by ABC News about how it felt to be back in the White House. â€œWhat a great feeling, one of the better feelings I've ever had,â€ Trump said.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-record-breaking-day-1-executive-actions-prompt/story?id=117933368",
         "Armed with plenty of black Sharpies, President Donald Trump shattered the record for most executive orders signed on his first day in office and became the only commander-in-chief to partly do so in an arena packed with thousands of people. But the nation's 47th president is already facing legal challenges to some of his most controversial executive actions and others have stoked outrage. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech on Monday. \"It's all about common sense.\" With those words, Trump immediately began rescinding numerous executive actions taken by now-former President Joe Biden, alleging in a written preamble published with his presidential actions that \"the previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government.\" Trump said his executive actions represent his administration's priorities of protecting the southern U.S. border, reforming and improving government bureaucracy and unleashing American energy by ending Bidenâ€™s policies of climate and streamlining permitting that he contends has stymied energy production. Another goal, he said, is to protect women from \"radical gender ideology\" and recognize only two sexes, male and female. \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" Trump said in his inauguration speech. In another unprecedented move, Trump signed his first eight executive actions in front of a wildly enthusiastic crowd filling Washington D.C.'s 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, capping his inauguration parade. \"President Trump has really made political theater a core part of how he uses unilateral power,\" Jon Rogowski, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. \"He wants to make sure people know he has taken action thatâ€™s consistent with the kinds of campaign promises that he made when he was running for office.\" Executive orders are signed, official documents through which the president manages the operations of the federal government and provides instructions to the executive branch about how to interpret the law, Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington D.C., told ABC News. \"An executive order is a directive issued by the president that goes into the Federal Register. It has the force of law, but it does not require an act of Congress,\" Lichtman said. \"Although it has the force of law, it can be repealed by a subsequent president issuing executive orders of his or her own.\" Lichtman said that unlike laws passed by Congress, executive orders are more vulnerable to challenges in the courts, either substantive or procedural. \"The reason why we are seeing the government by executive order is twofold: Donald Trump was singularly ineffective in getting his agenda through Congress during his first term, even with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate during his first two years. The second reason is they have such a thin majority in the House,\" Lichtman said. In the past, executive orders were typically challenged after the federal government took action to implement them and someone claimed they had been harmed by that executive action, Rogowski told ABC News. \"Now, it has changed. Presidents are being sued immediately after they sign an executive order by organizations who represent collections of individuals or by states' attorneys general,\" Rogowski said. Rogowski said that during Trump's first term â€œit became more common for groups and for states to directly challenge the president immediately upon the issuance of the directive with which they disagreed.â€ \"Over the last decade, thereâ€™s been more organization on the ground and among legal groups and states to put pressure on the presidential administrationâ€™s use of executive action,\" Rogowski said. Trump on Monday granted 1,500 people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon\" and commuted the sentences of 14 others involved in the riot. Trump called them \"hostages.\" The Constitution gives a sitting president the power to grant clemency to just about anybody and such actions cannot be reversed. Before leaving office on Monday, Biden issued a slew of preemptive pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including several close relatives, Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney. \"What they have done to these people is outrageous,\" Trump said while signing the pardons and commutations in the Oval Office. The pardons and commutations immediately sparked a backlash from both Democrats, Republicans and the union representing members of the U.S. Capitol Police. \"The president's actions are an outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. Former Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., an ABC News contributor, called the pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters \"unsettling\" to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. \"They weren't 'hostages,' they were defendants. I was there,\" Katko told ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis on Monday night. \"A lot of people in the Capitol were beaten. I saw a lot of officers that were severely beaten and injured that night. It was a bad scene.\" The National Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing U.S. Capitol Police officers, released a statement, saying, \"The vast majority of Americans do not support letting criminals off scott-free or being given lighter sentences when theyâ€™ve attacked law enforcement officers.\" Another controversial executive order Trump signed was one aiming to cut off birthright citizenship. Critics immediately pounced on Trump, arguing people born in the United States are granted citizenship under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment even if their birth parents migrated here illegally. Asked by reporters if he expected the order to prompt legal challenges, Trump responded, \"We'll see. We have very good grounds. People have wanted to do this for decades.\" Five federal lawsuits were filed already this week, challenging Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. One was filed in Massachusetts federal court by 19 Democratic state attorneys general, the city of San Francisco and the District of Columbia, accusing Trump of seeking to eliminate a \"well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle.\" A similar federal lawsuit was filed by the states of Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. The American Civil Liberties Union also backed another lawsuit filed in New Hampshire asking the court to block Trump's order. \"We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail,â€ said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU. A separate lawsuit filed in Massachusetts U.S. District Court was brought by an undocumented expectant mother and two nonprofit groups, arguing the executive order is an attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to nearly every person born in the United States. A fifth lawsuit was filed late Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland on behalf of two nonprofit groups, five pregnant undocumented women and their future children. In other executive actions, Trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border, saying, \"Americaâ€™s sovereignty is under attack.\" \"Our southern border is overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans, including America,\" the proclamation reads. \"This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.\" Trump also issued an executive order designating certain cartels as foreign terrorists. He signed yet another executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Many of the proposed executive orders require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles. \"We have to relate as equals, not subordinates,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in reaction to Trump's executive orders pertaining to the southern border. Sheinbaum said her focus is on defending Mexicans and her country's Constitution. \"You have to keep a cool head with what he signed,\" Sheinbaum said. \"You have to read the decrees. In fact, we continue to study them because some of them went out very late at night and we have a team working on that.\" Sheinbaum said some of Trump's executive actions are similar to ones he signed during his first term, including the one proclaiming a national emergency at the southern border. \"There was cooperation between the two governments at that time,\" Sheinbaum said. \"When President Biden comes in, he removes it and now President Trump reinstates it.\" Sheinbaum said Trump's executive action to prevent asylum seekers from entering the U.S. from Mexico is almost identical to the decree he made in 2018. As far as changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, Sheinbaum said, \"For us and the world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico.\" \"We will always act in the defense of our independence, the defense of our fellow nationals living in the U.S.,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We act within the framework of our constitution and laws. We always act with a cool head.\" Rogowski said legal challenges could delay the executive orders from being put in place. â€œI donâ€™t want to undermine the chances that any of these could have real, tangible consequences for people, but I suspect Trump is going to find it frustrating that many of his actions that he intends to have an immediate effect are instead going to be held up in court for weeks, months or even years, in some cases,\" Rogowski said. During his first term, Trump signed an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days, suspended entry to the country of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prohibited any other refugees from coming into the country for 120 days. Rogowski noted that legal challenges stymied the so-called Muslim ban for 10 months and forced Trump to issue two revised versions of the ban before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it in a 5-3 ruling issued in June 2018. Trump also issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, alleging the organization mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic. As he did in his first term, Trump signed an executive order removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to mitigate climate change that was enacted in 2016. Trump said the agreement doesn't reflect U.S. values and directs \"American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\" Rogowski said some of the executive actions taken by Trump, like changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico and restoring the name of America's 25th president, William McKinley, to the highest peak in North America, are primarily \"symbolic.\" Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America \"is not going to advance any of Trump's economic goals or priorities that he outlines, other than make a symbolic change,\" Rogowski said. Lichtman agreed. \"They're symbolic in that they resonate with themes that Trump has been professing ever since he arrived in presidential politics a decade ago,\" he said. But Lichtman added that many of Trump's executive orders \"are real and they have a real impact on the American people.\"",

are granted citizenship under the constitution amendment even if their birth parents migrated here illegally asked by reporters if he expected the order to prompt legal challenges trump responded we see we have very good grounds people have wanted to do this for decades five federal lawsuits were filed already this week challenging trump birthright citizenship executive order one was filed in massachusetts federal court by democratic state attorneys general the city of san francisco and the district of columbia accusing trump of seeking to eliminate a well established and longstanding constitutional principle a similar federal lawsuit was filed by the states of arizona oregon washington and illinois the american civil liberties union also backed another lawsuit filed in new hampshire asking the court to block trump order we will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of americans go unchallenged the trump administration overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail said anthony romero executive director of the aclu a separate lawsuit filed in massachusetts district court was brought by an undocumented expectant mother and two nonprofit groups arguing the executive order is an attempt to reinterpret the amendment guarantee of citizenship to nearly every person born in the united states a fifth lawsuit was filed late tuesday in district court in maryland on behalf of two nonprofit groups five pregnant undocumented women and their future children in other executive actions trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern border saying america sovereignty is under attack our southern border is overrun by cartels criminal gangs known terrorists human traffickers smugglers unvetted military age males from foreign adversaries and illicit narcotics that harm americans including america the proclamation reads this invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last years trump also issued an executive order designating certain cartels as foreign terrorists he signed yet another executive order changing the name of the gulf of mexico to the gulf of america many of the proposed executive orders require help from international partners like mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles we have to relate as equals not subordinates mexican president claudia sheinbaum said tuesday in reaction to trump executive orders pertaining to the southern border sheinbaum said her focus is on defending mexicans and her country constitution you have to keep a cool head with what he signed sheinbaum said you have to read the decrees in fact we continue to study them because some of them went out very late at night and we have a team working on that sheinbaum said some of trump executive actions are similar to ones he signed during his first term including the one proclaiming a national emergency at the southern border there was cooperation between the two governments at that time sheinbaum said when president biden comes in he removes it and now president trump reinstates it sheinbaum said trump executive action to prevent asylum seekers from entering the from mexico is almost identical to the decree he made in as far as changing the name of the gulf of mexico sheinbaum said for us and the world it is still the gulf of mexico we will always act in the defense of our independence the defense of our fellow nationals living in the sheinbaum said we act within the framework of our constitution and laws we always act with a cool head rogowski said legal challenges could delay the executive orders from being put in place i do want to undermine the chances that any of these could have real tangible consequences for people but i suspect trump is going to find it frustrating that many of his actions that he intends to have an immediate effect are instead going to be held up in court for weeks months or even years in some cases rogowski said during his first term trump signed an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly muslim countries from entering the united states for days suspended entry to the country of all syrian refugees indefinitely and prohibited any other refugees from coming into the country for days rogowski noted that legal challenges stymied the so called muslim ban for months and forced trump to issue two revised versions of the ban before the supreme court upheld it in a ruling issued in june trump also issued an executive order withdrawing the united states from the world health organization alleging the organization mishandled the pandemic as he did in his first term trump signed an executive order removing the united states from the paris agreement an international treaty to mitigate climate change that was enacted in trump said the agreement does reflect values and directs american taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require or merit financial assistance in the interests of the american people rogowski said some of the executive actions taken by trump like changing the name of the gulf of mexico and restoring the name of america president william mckinley to the highest peak in north america are primarily symbolic renaming the gulf of mexico to the gulf of america is not going to advance any of trump economic goals or priorities that he outlines other than make a symbolic change rogowski said lichtman agreed they symbolic in that they resonate with themes that trump has been professing ever since he arrived in presidential politics a decade ago he said but lichtman added that many of trump executive orders are real and they have a real impact on the american people",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-criticizes-sermon-show-mercy-lgbtq-people-immigrants/story?id=117950533",
         "Following a traditional inaugural prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday, during which an Episcopal bishop called on President Donald Trump to show \"mercy\" toward LGBTQ people and immigrants, he told reporters the sermon \"wasn't too exciting\" and added he \"didn't think it was a good service.\" The National Prayer Service was one of several events presidents attend around being sworn in. \"What did you think? Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting, was it? I didn't think it was a good service, no,\" Trump said to reporters following the service. Then, in a Truth Social post early Wednesday morning, Trump called the bishop of Washington, the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, \"a Radical Left hard line Trump hater.\" \"She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way. She was nasty in tone, and not compelling or smart,\" Trump said. \"Apart from her inappropriate statements, the service was a very boring and uninspiring one. She is not very good at her job! She and her church owe the public an apology!\" Trump added. Budde defended her sermon against Trump's criticism, telling ABC's \"The View\" on Wednesday that she sought to create \"unity\" and to \"counter the narrative that is so divisive and polarizing.\" \"I wanted to emphasize respecting the honor and dignity of every human being, basic honesty and humility and then I also realized that unity requires a certain degree of mercy -- mercy and compassion and understanding,\" she said. \"I was trying to speak a truth that I felt needed to be said, but to do it as respectful and kind a way as I could,\" she added. \"And also to bring other voices into the conversation â€¦ voices that had not been heard in the public space for some time.\" When asked if she had an opportunity to share her thoughts one-on-one with the president, Budde said she had not been invited but would welcome the opportunity and would be \"as respectful as I would with any person.\" She added that the invitation would have to come from him. In her sermon, Budde addressed Trump directly from the pulpit. \"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives,\" Budde said. \"They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals,\" she continued. \"They pay taxes and are good neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues, gurdwara and temples. I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here.\" Throughout the sermon, Trump, in the front pew, had a stoic expression, flipping through his program and scanning the room. He looked up only during the hymns, sometimes moving his head to the music. Melania Trump was seen stifling a yawn and shifting around to stay alert. A majority of Trump family members were seated behind the Trumps. Bishop Budde has previously spoken out against Trump. In 2020, following Trump's ordering of the National Guard to disperse protestors with tear gas to stage a photo-op with an upside-down Bible, she criticized the president for using the Church and a Bible to justify his actions. Speaking to ABC's Good Morning America, Budde said the president's photo-op was \"as if it were spiritual validation and justification for a message that is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and to the God of justice.\"",

         "President Donald Trump on Wednesday sent a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin telling him to make a deal now to end the war in Ukraine, threatening economic consequences if he doesn't. \"It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\" Trump wrote in a new social media post. Trump indicated that if a deal isn't made quickly, he would place high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on Russia. \"Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don't make a \"deal,\" and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,\" Trump said. Trump then threatened that it can be done \"the easy way, or the hard way.\" Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday night, Trump indicated he'd be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin in person. \"I'll be meeting with President Putin,\" Trump said, but didn't say when that might happen. Trump also indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy was willing to come to the negotiating table, but is unsure if Putin would, too. \"He told me he wants to make a deal. He wants to make -- Zelenskyy wants to make a deal. I don't know if Putin does,\" Trump said. During the ABC News debate in September, Trump claimed he would settle the war between Russia and Ukraine before he got into office. At one point, he had also signaled that the war would be over within 24 hours of becoming president..",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-authorizes-ice-target-schools-churches/story?id=117954409",
         "Federal immigration authorities will be permitted to target schools and churches after President Donald Trump revoked a directive barring arrests in â€œsensitiveâ€ areas. The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday it would roll back the policy to \"thwart law enforcement in or near so-called sensitive areas.\" First enacted in 2011, the directive prohibited Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol officers from arresting suspected undocumented immigrants in a variety of locations. Schools and houses of worship were deemed off-limits, as were hospitals, funerals, weddings and public demonstrations. In a statement touting the move Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said law enforcement would use \"common sense\" in making arrests. \"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens -- including murders and rapists -- who have illegally come into our country,\" the spokesperson said. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" the statement continued. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\" ICE can also now conduct immigration raids near courthouses, according to a memo obtained Wednesday by ABC News. The guidance is sharply different from the prior administration, which did not allow ICE to conduct enforcement operations at or near courthouses. \"ICE officers or agents may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action will take place,\" the memo sent to ICE employees said. The memo also said ICE should go after those who are in court for criminal proceedings and not civil matters, like in family court or small claims court. \"Additionally, civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses should, to the extent practicable, continue to take place in non-public areas of the courthouse, be conducted in collaboration with court security staff, and utilize the court building's non-public entrances and exits. When practicable, ICE officers and agents will conduct civil immigration enforcement actions against targeted aliens discreetly to minimize their impact on court proceedings,\" the memo said. \"ICE officers and agents should generally avoid enforcement actions in or near court-houses, or areas within courthouses, that are wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings (e.g., family court, small claims court).\" ICE will also change their terminology at Trump's direction, according to another internal memo obtained by ABC News. From now on, those they are arresting will be referred to as \"alien,\" as opposed to \"noncitizen,\" and those in the country illegally will be referred to as \"illegal alien,\" the memo said. \"ICE employees are directed to use the lexicon consistent with the immigration and nationality act and the language historically used by the agency,\" the memo said. Former President Joe Biden's administration changed the language in 2021 when former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued terminology guidance.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/conflicting-accounts-congressional-republicans-approach-trumps-agenda/story?id=117959679",
         "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance brainstormed in the Oval Office on Tuesday on a path to execute the presidentâ€™s ambitious agenda amid narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress with the top two congressional Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Conflicting accounts came out of the meeting on whether Republicans will pursue a single-track strategy on budget reconciliation. Johnson said there was a â€œgreat spirit of unityâ€ -- though he declined to confirm whether Senate Republicans agreed to pursue one reconciliation bill -- saying only that the plan is â€œpretty well formulated.â€ â€œIâ€™m not going to talk about the discussions that we had, but we do have a strategy that weâ€™re all working on together. It will be bicameral and thereâ€™s a lot of excitement about that,â€ Johnson said upon his return to the Capitol on Tuesday evening. â€œIt was a great meeting,â€ Johnson said. â€œWe talked about strategy and priorities for the Congress and where we are and where weâ€™re headed.â€ â€œI can tell you the Republican Party is united and excited,â€ Johnson added. Trump, for his part, told reporters that he was pushing for â€œone big bill, pretty much,â€ saying that Republicans might have leverage in providing disaster relief funding for the wildfires in Los Angeles. â€œI think we have a good situation,\" Trump said. \"Now, it's been in some ways, made simpler by Los Angeles, because they're going to need a lot of money. And, generally speaking, I think you find that a lot of Democrats are going to be asking for help. So I think maybe that makes it more one-sided.â€ Thune told reporters that the meeting â€œcovered a lot of groundâ€ and â€œtalked through all the issues.â€ â€œThat discussion is always predicated on what we can get done and weâ€™re obviously all interested in getting to the same destination, so weâ€™ve got several deadlines ahead of us,â€ Thune said. â€œThereâ€™s a lot to do and part of it is figuring out how to stage it.â€ â€œWell, there are lots of great theories, but thereâ€™s always a difference when you have to translate that into practice,â€ Thune added. But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joined a larger meeting of Republican leaders with Trump in the Cabinet Room, revealed that they agreed to move forward on one measure. â€œWe are moving forward with one bill,â€ Scalise said. Pressed whether Thune agreed to the one-bill strategy, Scalise answered, â€œYeah.â€ Scalise said Republicans have not made a final decision on when to take up the debt limit but signaled it could be tied to government funding, which expires on March 14. Trump is set to meet with a group of moderate House Republicans on Wednesday afternoon at the White House, multiple sources told ABC News. Some of the members who will attend include Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, New York Rep. Mike Lawler and others. â€œEveryone who was there will say it was a delightful meeting. Everybody is excited and ready to work, and we are going to deliver on the America First agenda,â€ Johnson said. â€œThe party is working in unison. The leaders in both chambers are working in a bicameral fashion and the president is all on board.â€ Thune signaled recess appointments were discussed in the meeting -- explaining â€œthatâ€™s something that heâ€™s expressed an interest in the pastâ€ as he pivoted to pressure Democrats to support Trumpâ€™s nominees. The Supreme Court in a 2014 decision gave the executive branch broad leeway to fill executive branch vacancies when the Senate is not in session, even for political purposes such as difficulty securing Senate confirmation. The court's guidelines for the process notes that the Senate is in recess \"when it says it is\" and that the Constitution requires the recess to last 10 days or more for a president to be able to fill a position. A vote of the House is also necessary to approve an adjournment of 10 days or more. The Constitution's Adjournment's Clause says neither chamber should be out of session \"for more than three days\" without consent of the other. -ABC News' Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mark-milleys-portrait-removed-pentagon-hallway/story?id=117908299",
         "The White House ordered that retired Gen. Mark Milley's official portrait as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be taken down from the Pentagon hallway where all of the paintings of the previous chairmen are located on Monday, sources told ABC News. Two U.S. officials confirmed that the portrait of Milley, whom President Donald Trump suggested could be executed for treason on Truth Social in 2023, had been taken down from that hallway, and one of the officials said the whereabouts of the Milley portrait is currently unknown. The portrait was unveiled on Friday, Jan. 10, at a ceremony in that hallway, with both Milley and then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin present. The portrait's disappearance was first noted by reporters at the Pentagon who observed the empty space where the portrait hung just a few hours before, and on Tuesday, Pentagon maintenance staff spackled the holes where the hooks had been that held up the painting, as well as the holes where the nameplate with the dates of his tenure used to hang next to the painting. Staffers then painted over the entire wall where it had hung, making it unlikely the portrait will be put back up soon. ABC News reached out to the White House for comment. Milley, who was preemptively pardoned on Monday by then-President Joe Biden as part of a last-minute slate of pardons, retired as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2023. Appointed by Trump during is first administration in July 2018, Milley drew ire from Republican officials following the United States' military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. \"My family and I are deeply grateful for the President's action today,\" he said. \"After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our Nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights. I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety. \"It has been an honor and a privilege to serve our great country in uniform for over four decades, and I will continue to keep faith and loyalty to our nation and Constitution until my dying breath,\" Milley added. At the time of his appointment, Trump called Milley a \"great gentleman\" and a \"great soldier.\" However, their relationship began to sour in the summer of 2020, after Milley expressed regret for having accompanied Trump to St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington hours after Lafayette Square was cleared by police and the National Guard of protesters. Months later, after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Trump reportedly felt betrayed that Milley had called his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Li Zuocheng, to assure him the U.S. was \"100 percent steady.\" In unscripted remarks in Emancipation Hall following his inaugural address on Monday, Trump questioned why Biden pardoned Milley, as well as former Rep. Liz Cheney and Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"Why are we doing this? Why are we trying to help a guy like Milley?\" he said. \"Why are we doing Milley? He was pardoned. What he said -- terrible, what he said.\" Biden expressed concerns about political retribution in his defense of the slate of preemptive pardons. \"These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,\" he said in a statement. \"Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. \"That is why I am exercising my authority under the Constitution to pardon General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Members of Congress and staff who served on the Select Committee, and the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the Select Committee,\" he added. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.\"",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-order-leaves-afghans-approved-resettle-us-limbo/story?id=117947379",
         "President Donald Trump's executive order freezing refugee programs could impact thousands of Afghans approved to resettle as refugees in the United States, according to one major advocacy organization. That includes family members of U.S. service members and Afghans who served alongside the U.S. military in partner forces, as well as others \"who in one way or another are connected to the U.S. mission and are at risk through their association with us,\" Shawn VanDiver, the president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition working to bring Afghans safely out of Afghanistan, told ABC News. \"We have a commitment there,\" he said. \"Our national security promises can't be conditional based on who is in the Oval Office.\" VanDiver confirmed a Reuters report that nearly 1,660 Afghans cleared to resettle in the U.S. could have their flights canceled. As of Tuesday, the flights have not been canceled as the administration works through the order, which takes effect on Jan. 27. The program will be suspended for at least 90 days, according to the order, after which the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will submit a report to the president on whether restarting the program \"would be in the interests of the United States.\" If it is suspended indefinitely, it could wind up affecting as many as 30,000 to 40,000 Afghans currently in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Qatar, some of whom could face reprisals from the Taliban for cooperating with American forces, VanDiver said. America's \"bilateral relationships are at risk here,\" he said. \"Our partners need to be able to trust our word.\" ABC News spoke to half a dozen senators Tuesday about the status of Afghan refugees. Several Republicans -- including Trump allies like Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota -- are in favor of clarifying the order to make sure that thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. in Afghanistan aren't left in limbo. \"I'd like to get them back here if there associated with helping our cause,\" Graham told ABC News. \"I hope they can work through that. The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan was traumatic enough,\" Cramer said. \"One of the reasons was that it left behind so many of our allies.\" The White House, State Department and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to ABC News' questions about the order and its impact on vetted Afghan refugees. \"I can't imagine that their intention was to include interpreters and allies in Afghanistan who helped us, and we left them behind,\" Cramer said, adding that veterans groups have expressed concern to him about the status of Afghans under the new executive order.",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marco-rubio-sworn-secretary-state-discusses-foreign-conflict/story?id=117937809",
         "After taking the oath of office to be sworn in as the nation's 72nd secretary of state, Marco Rubio promised that every action taken by the State Department will be determined by the answers to three questions: \"Does it make us stronger? Does it make us safer? And does it make us more prosperous?\" The Senate unanimously confirmed Rubio's appointment to secretary of state Monday evening, making Rubio the first confirmed Cabinet member of the second Trump administration. Rubio also gave remarks in Spanish, giving thanks to God and his family members both present and not present -- including his parents, who he said came to the United States in 1956 and that the purpose of their lives was that their children could realize dreams that were not possible for them. Rubio, a Cuban American son of refugees, is the first Hispanic American ever to hold this position. \"It's an incredible honor to be the secretary of state of the most powerful, best country in the world,\" he continued in Spanish, thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity. Switching back to English, Rubio joked, \"I just said I saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico -- that's what I said.\" The former senator also echoed themes from Trump's inaugural address and reiterated the president's platform. \"[Trump's] primary promise when it comes to foreign policy is that the priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States. It will be furthering the national interest of this country,\" Rubio said. \"We will work hard every second of the day to help him achieve the agenda the American people have given him to achieve,\" he added. In addition to thanking his former colleagues, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Idaho Sen. James Risch, Rubio expressed gratitude to his family and emphasized that \"the most important job I'll ever have is that of a father and husband.\" Rubio told State Department employees later Tuesday that he wanted the department to \"be where it belongs -- I want the Department of State to be at the center of how America engages the world.\" \"There will be changes. But the changes are not meant to be destructive,\" Rubio added. \"They're not meant to be punitive, they're not -- the changes will be because we need to be a 21st century agency that can move, by a clichÃ© that's used by many, at the speed of relevancy. But we need to move faster than we ever have because the world is changing faster.\" Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony Tuesday morning, Rubio spoke with CBS and was asked about Trump's statement that he is \"not confident\" the ceasefire in Gaza will hold. \"Well, I'm hoping and praying it will hold -- but remember, on Oct. 6 there was a ceasefire in place between Israel and Hamas. Oct. 7 was a violation of that,\" Rubio said. \"So when you're dealing with a terrorist organization that has committed atrocities, motivated by all kinds of evil, I don't think you can go into it very confident that things will hold in the long term. \"We want it to work out. We think there is the broader hope of a peace in the region,\" he added. \"So we're hopeful, but I think we need to be realistic about what we're dealing with here.\" Rubio also spoke with ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and discussed Trump's pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, TikTok and the Russia-Ukraine war. Rubio sidestepped directly weighing on the pardons, saying his \"focus needs to be 100% on how I interact with our counterparts, our adversaries, our potential enemies around the world to keep this country safe, to make it prosperous.\" When asked about Trump's campaign pledge to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on Day One, Rubio contended the matter is more complex and that negotiations will not be played out in public. \"Look, this is a complex, tragic conflict, one that was started by Vladimir Putin that's inflicted a tremendous amount of damage on Ukraine and also on Russia, I would argue, but also on the stability of Europe,\" Rubio said. \"So the only way to solve these things, we got to get back to pragmatism, but we also get back to seriousness here, and that is the hard work of diplomacy. The U.S. has a role to play here. We've been supportive of Ukraine, but this conflict has to end.\"",

         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-bolton-trump-removed-secret-service-detail/story?id=117951969",
         "President Donald Trump has terminated Secret Service protection for his former national security adviser John Bolton, Bolton said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon. \"Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to extend that protection to me in 2021. The Justice Department filed criminal charges against an Iranian Revolutionary Guard official in 2022 for attempting to hire a hit man to target me. That threat remains today,\" Bolton wrote. \"The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\" The White House has not commented on Bolton's claims. Bolton worked as Trump's national security adviser from 2018 to 2019 and was frequently at odds with the president. After he left office, Bolton was vocal about his criticisms of Trump's policies, including in a 2020 memoir in which he claimed the president was \"stunningly uninformed,\" ignorant of basic facts and easily manipulated by foreign adversaries. At the time of the book's release, Bolton told ABC News' Martha Raddatz that Trump was \"not fit for office\" and didn't have \"the competence to carry out the job.\" Trump has lashed out at Bolton since leaving office in social media posts and interviews. On Monday, he signed an executive order that called for Bolton to lose any security clearance he might still hold. The executive order accused Bolton of publishing a memoir that \"was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government,\" with the order adding that the book's publication \"created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\" Bolton has denied disclosing any classified information in the book, and though a federal judge was skeptical of that, no charges were ever filed.",

         "With the stroke of the pen, Trump tries to remake America: ANALYSIS",
         "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stroke-pen-trump-remake-america-analysis/story?id=117941483",
         "With half the country firmly behind him and with the blessing of America's tech billionaires, President Donald Trump is moving at a breakneck pace to try to remake America. Using sweeping declarations of presidential power that go well beyond those in his first term, Trump has promised to upend how the federal government views the rights of migrants and trans people. The Gulf of Mexico will become the \"Gulf of America,\" he says. Alaska's Denali mountain peak will once again honor President William McKinley, who never visited but favored tariffs like Trump. And the 1798 law used to justify Japanese internment camps during World War II will be invoked, Trump promises -- this time, to go after foreign-born criminals, he said. Trump ordered an end to birthright citizenship too, even as many legal experts said that wasn't actually possible and opponents sued. But Trump insisted the 14th Amendment of the Constitution -- which grants citizenship to any person born inside the United States -- should now take into account the legal status of a person's birth parents. In yet another executive order, Trump suggested security clearances should be pulled from more than two dozen retired government intelligence officials who, just weeks before the 2020 election, challenged Republican narratives about emails purportedly found on Hunter Bidenâ€™s laptop, calling them possible Russian propaganda. And TikTok was suddenly resurrected when Trump said its Chinese-based parent company could ignore for now a bipartisan law passed by Congress requiring it to sell the app or shut it down. To the public, Trump's unilateral flash of executive power might seem extraordinary. But history suggests it also could be short-lived without Congress and the courts behind it as opposition groups ready lawsuits, experts say. Marsha Barrett, a political historian and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said there's certainly precedent for presidents forcing change when Congress won't act, like when President Harry Truman ordered to desegregate the military. \"But relying so heavily on that power on the first day could be interpreted as an effort to demonstrate that the executive branch has eclipsed the congressional branch,\" Barrett said. \"While executive orders are undeniably an expression of sweeping presidential power, I think its application has a hollowness in comparison to presidents who executed much of their platform through Congress.\" In other words, without getting Congress firmly on board first, everything Trump declared on his first day in office can be undone just as quickly four years from now when he leaves office. There's also the question of how much of an impact it would have on government services Americans rely on. \"The proof is in the pudding and it is worth paying real attention to whether and how they execute on this vision,\" said Max Stier, founder and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. The federal government needs \"constructive reform,\" Stier added, \"not choices that will further erode the capabilities of our public institutions.\" Eight years ago, many of Trump's executive orders would have been likely been rebuked as \"un-American\" by critics like the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and decried by Democratic governors. But with the Republican party now firmly remade in his image, Trump arrived in Washington this week feted as any other politician might. Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, joined the new president his inauguration ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Elon Musk, the billionaire who heads Tesla, SpaceX and the social media site X, is said to be given an all-access pass to the White House as one of Trump's closest informal advisers. Also on Trump's side is a Republican-controlled House and Senate, as well as a U.S. Supreme Court with several of his own hand-picked justices who have shown they are willing to side with him in many instances. Democratic governors running states that swung behind Trump in the election also seemed to temper their criticism, at least for now. \"I stand ready to work with the Trump Administration to continue our progress here in Pennsylvania,\" said Gov. Josh Shapiro, once a top contender to serve in a Harris administration but is now up for re-election next year. \"At the same time, as I have done throughout my career, I will always defend our fundamental freedoms and stand up to efforts to erode them,\" he added, while also noting there is \"more that unites us as Americans than divides us.\" Nationwide, Trump won 49.9% of the popular vote, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris's 48.4%, according to final election returns. That means the new president will govern a country deeply divided on his leadership with many Americans wary, ambivalent or directly opposed to his final term as president. Soon after Trump's swearing in, liberal advocacy groups like Public Citizen, ACLU and Democracy Forward began filing lawsuits. To Trump though, his return to Washington signaled a new \"golden age\" as he insisted much of the country was solidly behind him. \"Nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours and our golden age has just begun,\" he said.",
